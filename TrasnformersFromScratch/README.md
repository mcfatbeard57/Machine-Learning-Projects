# Transformers from Scratch in PyTorch

## Project Description:

This repository delves into the inner workings of Transformers, a powerful deep learning architecture revolutionizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. It offers a hands-on implementation, built from the ground up using PyTorch's neural network functionalities.

## Key Transformer Attributes:

1. **Layer Normalization:**

    - **Explanation:** Imagine a group of students with varying performance levels. Layer normalization, like a supportive teacher, adjusts their scores to have a similar average and range, enabling smoother learning in the network.
    
    - **Technical Details:** Inspired by Batch Normalization, this technique normalizes the outputs of each layer independently, mitigating internal covariate shift and improving gradient flow during training.

2. **Multi-Head Attention:**

    - **Explanation:** Think of a group conversation where you can selectively listen to different individuals while understanding the overall context. Multi-head attention allows the model to focus on various aspects of input sequences simultaneously, creating richer representations.
    
    - **Technical Details:** This mechanism projects the input into multiple subspaces (heads), enabling parallel computation and capturing diverse relationships within the data. Attention scores are calculated, indicating the relevance of one element to another, and used to weigh their contributions in the output.

3. **Positional Encoding:**

    - **Explanation:** In a sentence, the order of words matters. Positional encoding injects positional information into the model's representation, helping it differentiate between the same words in different contexts, just like humans instinctively understand sentence structure.
    
    - **Technical Details:** This is often achieved through sine and cosine functions, adding information about the position of each element within the sequence to the original embedding.

4. **Self-Attention:**

    - **Explanation:** Self-attention empowers the model to "attend" to different parts of an input sequence, similar to how you might reread a sentence to grasp its nuances. This allows it to understand the relationships between words within the same sequence.
    
    - **Technical Details:** The model calculates similarities between elements in the same sequence and uses these scores to generate a weighted context vector, incorporating relevant information from different positions.

5. **Sentence Tokenizer:**

    - **Explanation:** Consider breaking down a lengthy speech into individual sentences for easier understanding. A sentence tokenizer acts as a preparatory step, dividing the input text into individual sentences, which are then processed by the main model components.
    
    - **Technical Details:** This typically involves regular expressions or pre-trained libraries like spaCy to split the text based on sentence delimiters (e.g., full stops, periods).

6. **Encoder:**

    - **Explanation:** The encoder acts like a "thought processor" responsible for analyzing and summarizing the input sequence. It applies multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward networks to extract comprehensive representations of the input.
    
    - **Technical Details:** It consists of stacked layers, each usually containing a multi-head attention module followed by a position-wise feed-forward network and layer normalization. The encoder progressively builds a contextual representation of the input.

7. **Decoder:**

    - **Explanation:** The decoder acts as a "word generator," building an output sequence one token at a time, conditioned on the encoded representation from the encoder. It leverages self-attention to focus on relevant parts of the encoded sequence while employing masked attention to prevent the model from "looking ahead" during generation, ensuring proper autoregressive output.
    
    - **Technical Details:** Similar to the encoder, the decoder uses stacked layers with self-attention and feed-forward networks. Additionally, masked multi-head attention prevents the model from predicting the next token based on all subsequent information, maintaining a natural text-generating flow.
