 **I'm ready to generate interview questions based on your project description! Please share the relevant details, and I'll tailor questions to help you solidify your understanding and prepare for potential inquiries.**

**Here are key takeaways I've gathered from the provided code snippets, which you can incorporate into your answers:**

**Segmentation Integration:**

- Leveraged DETR (Detection Transformer) for precise lung region segmentation.
- Demonstrated integration of pre-trained models for object detection and segmentation tasks.
- Used Detectron2 library for implementation and visualization.

**Transfer Learning:**

- Employed transfer learning with a stronger backbone (ResNet-50) to enhance feature extraction.
- Effectively froze earlier layers of the backbone for fine-tuning on a specific dataset.
- Showcased creation of a new classifier layer aligned with the classification task.

**Class Imbalance Handling:**

- Created a custom WeightedLoss function to address class imbalance during training.
- Demonstrated calculation of class weights based on dataset distribution.
- Highlighted importance of experimenting with different weighting strategies for optimal results.

**Data Augmentation:**

- Utilized the Albumentations library for diverse image augmentation techniques.
- Implemented a pipeline including flipping, rotation, elastic deformations, gamma correction, and normalization.
- Emphasized the need for experimentation and adjusting techniques based on dataset and task requirements.

**Ensemble Learning:**

- Illustrated simple averaging for combining predictions from multiple models (ViT and ResNet-50).
- Demonstrated independent training of each model followed by ensemble prediction.
- Suggested exploring more sophisticated ensemble methods for potentially improved performance.
