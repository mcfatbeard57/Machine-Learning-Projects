    "– The accuracy score of a supervised learning method can vary, depending on which samples happen to end up in the training set.\n",

The proper way to do cross-validation when you need to scale the data is not to scale the entire dataset with a single transform, since this will indirectly leak information into the training data about the whole dataset, including the test data. \n",
